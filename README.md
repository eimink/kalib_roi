# Kalib Roi

You find yourself stranded on a broken spaceship. You must calibrate the navigation equipment with a bit glitchy console in order to find your way back home. This game uses a custom controller built with Arduino Uno while the main game is running On Raspberry Pi Zero with 4" HyperPixel display. The game was also coded using the same setup. Hints: Blue button shows you screen name and target value. Other buttons swap between screens. Use the three potentiometers to adjust values.

This game was created during Global Game Jam 2020.
